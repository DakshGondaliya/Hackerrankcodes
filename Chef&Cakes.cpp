/*
â–ºQuestion : Chef and Cakes

Chef Ashu has N bases for cakes. Bases with the same area can be placed over one another. Since Ashu is a lazy chef he wants to make
minimum number of cakes. You need to tell him the minimum number of cakes that he can make by using all the N bases and also the height
of the tallest cake that he can make.

Input Format

First line contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of bases.
Second line consists of N space separated integers A[i] denoting the areas of the bases.

Constraints

1 <= t <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

Output Format

Output consists of two space separated integers M and H denoting the minimum number of cakes that can be made by using all the bases and
the height of the tallest cake respectively.

Sample Input 0

6 5 6 7
Sample Output 0

3 2
Explanation 0

In the first example, chef makes minimum number of cakes by choosing (5, 6, 7) so total 3, and tallest cake is 6 (of height 2) other's 
are of height 1.*/
